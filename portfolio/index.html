    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
      My name is Ariana Jacpasad, I am a game developer and game designer who is
      from South Africa. I attend University of Witwatersrand.
      Here you can see my writings, the art made for different games, the games
      I have developed as well small things I call my test subjects.
     </p>
     <p> I have been interested in video games since a young age and naturally became interested in the development and design process. I always wondered how I would be able to provide an experience and my ideas in an interactive way that was able to be enjoyed by others.</p>
